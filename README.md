10 Days Challenge Program – Becoming a Malware Analyst

I’ve taken on a 10-day challenge to sharpen my skills and work towards becoming a Malware Analyst.

This repository serves as a central hub for:

Course materials

Practice scripts

Reference documents

Inside, you’ll find a dedicated folder named Test_Scripts_&_Documents_for_SpecialCourse. It is structured into subfolders for each day of the challenge. Every subfolder documents my daily learnings, exercises, and code samples, making it easy to track progress and revisit key concepts.
