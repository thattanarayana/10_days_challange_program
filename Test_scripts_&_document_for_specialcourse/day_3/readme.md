Day 3 Learning Journey: Electron Firebase File Manager

On the 3rd day of my learning journey, I explored Google Firebase, a powerful platform for building applications with real-time database capabilities. I extended my project by integrating a server to store data and a Python script to send commands remotely to Firebase, enabling real-time control over the desktop application.

ðŸ”§ Project Structure

index.html â†’ Contains HTML and JavaScript code that runs on the userâ€™s device. It serves as the frontend interface, but does not produce direct output.

main.js â†’ The core logic of the project. Handles Firebase configuration, database connections, and executes commands received in real-time.

package.json & package-lock.json â†’ Define project dependencies, libraries, and scripts required to run the Electron application.

admin.py â†’ A Python script using Firebase Service Account credentials. It establishes a connection to Firebase and sends commands to control main.js remotely.

ðŸš€ Project Overview

Electron Firebase File Manager is a desktop automation tool that allows remote file and folder management through Firebase Realtime Database. The app can also capture screenshots and scan for images. All commands are executed in real-time and updates are sent back to Firebase.

âš¡ Features
1. Folder Scan (scan)

Scans a folder or drive (first-level) and lists all files and directories.

Stores the folder structure in Firebase under commandData/folderStructure.

Captures file metadata including name, type, and size.

2. Image Scan (imagesscan)

Recursively scans a folder or drive for image files only.

Supported formats: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .bmp, .webp, .tiff.

Stores image details in Firebase under commandData/imageFiles with name, full path, and size.

3. Delete File/Folder (delete)

Safely deletes files or folders by moving them to the Recycle Bin.

Works with both files and directories.

Updates Firebase status with success or failure notifications.

4. Screenshots (screenshot)

Captures 3 screenshots of the Electron window.

Saves them locally in the src_capture folder.

Each screenshot is timestamped for easy tracking.

5. Exit Application (exit)

Remotely closes the Electron app via Firebase command.

6. Real-time Firebase Integration

Commands are sent to Firebase Realtime Database under commandData/cmd.

Status updates from the app are sent back to Firebase under commandData/status.

ðŸ“‚ Firebase Structure
commandData
â”‚
â”œâ”€ cmd : string          # Command to execute (scan, delete, screenshot, imagesscan, exit)
â”œâ”€ path : string         # Target folder or file path
â”œâ”€ status : string       # Status updates from Electron app
â”œâ”€ folderStructure : []  # Array of folder/file info generated by 'scan'
â””â”€ imageFiles : []       # Array of image info generated by 'imagesscan'

ðŸ’¡ Summary

This project demonstrates the power of combining Electron and Firebase for real-time remote control of desktop applications. By integrating a Python script, I can send commands remotely to manipulate files, scan for images, take screenshots, and monitor the app status instantly.

Itâ€™s an excellent example of real-time desktop automation using modern web technologies and cloud services.
