Day 01 – 19 Sept 2025

As part of my Electron learning practice, I worked on a few basic tasks that demonstrate how to use Electron for system-level operations such as capturing photos, taking screenshots, and deleting files from a folder.

Project Files

capture_photo.html – HTML file for capturing a photo using the laptop webcam (works with capture_photo.js).

capture_photo.js – JavaScript file that contains the logic for capturing a photo using the webcam.

deletefilesinfolder.html – HTML file for deleting files in a specific folder (works with deletefilesinfolder.js).

deletefilesinfolder.js – JavaScript file that handles deleting files inside a given folder.

screen_shot_captur.html – HTML file for taking screenshots (works with screen_shot_captur.js).

screen_shot_captur.js – JavaScript file that contains the logic for capturing screenshots.

package.json & package-lock.json – Setup files required to run the Electron project.

setup_electron.md – A step-by-step guide I created for setting up an Electron project.

Summary

This small project helped me practice:

Capturing images using a webcam.

Taking desktop screenshots.

Deleting files inside a folder.

Setting up and running a basic Electron application.
