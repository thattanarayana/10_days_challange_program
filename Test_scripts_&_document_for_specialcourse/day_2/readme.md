ðŸš€ Day 2 â€“ 20th Sept 2025

On the second day of my learning journey, I explored Google Firebase â€“ a powerful tool that helps in building applications with a real-time database.

I extended the project I started on Day 1 by integrating Firebase. This allowed me to receive commands directly from Firebase and execute them inside my Electron app.

After configuring the real-time database, I rewrote my code to continuously listen for input and execute commands until the program is terminated.

ðŸ”§ Project Structure

index.html â†’ Contains HTML and JavaScript code that runs on the userâ€™s device (no direct output is shown).

main.js â†’ The core logic of the project. Handles Firebase configuration, database connections, and executes commands received.

package.json & package-lock.json â†’ Define required libraries, dependencies, and scripts to run the Electron project.
